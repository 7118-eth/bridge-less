# Integration Test Results

## Test Environment
- **Local Node**: Anvil v1.2.1
- **Chain ID**: 31337
- **RPC URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8545

## Test Results Summary

### ✅ Successful Tests
1. **EVM RPC Connection** - Successfully connected to local Anvil node
2. **Contract Deployment Verification** - Token and HTLC contracts are deployed
3. **Account Balance Check** - Coordinator has 1000 tokens, User has 0 tokens
4. **Token Transfer** - Successfully transferred tokens from coordinator to user
5. **Transaction Signing** - Transactions are signed and sent successfully with correct chain ID

### ✅ Fixed Issues
1. **Swap Execution** - Full end-to-end swap flow now working
   - Approve transaction: ✅ Success
   - HTLC creation transaction: ✅ Success (gas used: 743001)
   - Event detection: ✅ Fixed - Corrected HTLCDeployed event signature

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Chain ID Configuration ✅ Fixed
- Added `evm_chain_id=31337` to all .env files
- Updated ConfigManager to load chain ID from environment
- Updated all test files to pass chain ID to EvmClient
- Key insight: viem's `localhost` chain uses ID 1337, but Anvil uses 31337

### 2. Address Normalization ✅ Fixed
- Used viem's `getAddress()` to properly checksum addresses
- Applied to all address parameters in EvmClient methods
- This resolved the "invalid chain id for signer" errors

### 3. BigInt Serialization ✅ Fixed
- Updated logger to handle BigInt values in JSON serialization
- Converts BigInt to string for proper logging

## Current Status

The integration with real EVM contracts is fully working:
- ✅ Transactions are being sent and confirmed
- ✅ Gas estimation and signing work correctly
- ✅ Token transfers execute successfully
- ✅ Event monitoring fixed - HTLCDeployed events now detected correctly

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Event Monitoring Fixed** - HTLCDeployed event signature corrected
2. **Complete End-to-End Test** - Full swap flow now working with corrected events
3. **Add WebSocket Support** - For real-time event monitoring
4. **Performance Testing** - Measure transaction times and optimize

## Event Detection Fix Details

The HTLCDeployed event was not being detected because the event signature in the code didn't match the actual ABI. 

**Incorrect signature in code:**
```
HTLCDeployed(address,address,bytes32,bytes32,address,bytes32,uint256,bytes32,uint256)
```

**Correct signature from ABI:**
```
HTLCDeployed(address,bytes32,address,address,bytes32,address,bytes32,uint256,bytes32,uint256)
```

The fix involved updating the event signature calculation in `src/chains/evm/htlc.ts` to match the actual event parameters defined in the HTLCFactory ABI.

## Test Infrastructure Status

The test infrastructure is fully functional with:
- ✅ Connection tests to verify RPC and contracts
- ✅ Token transfer tests
- ✅ End-to-end swap tests (event monitoring fixed and working)
- ✅ Failure scenario tests
- ✅ CLI-based integration tests

All core blockchain interactions are working correctly with Anvil.
